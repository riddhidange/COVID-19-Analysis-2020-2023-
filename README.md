# COVID-19-Analysis-2020-2023-

The COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, and despite widespread vaccination by 2023, its effects endure. As
society returns to a pre-pandemic, in-person mode, I am driven to reassess its consequences across different
geographical areas. In this comprehensive analysis project, I’ve delved into the critical issue of the COVID-19
pandemic. The choice of this topic is motivated by the ongoing challenges and concerns that have resurfaced
after what appeared to be initial progress in controlling the virus. The pandemic, which first emerged in late
2019, has had a profound global impact, leading to millions of cases and deaths, societal disruptions, and
economic consequences. In some regions, it seemed that the worst was behind us, but even now after 3 years,
recent developments have prompted a reevaluation of the situation.<br>
<br>
<b>Importance of this topic:</b><br>
The world has witnessed waves of infections, lockdowns, vaccination campaigns, and varying government
responses. These complexities have raised questions about the effectiveness of public health measures, vaccine
distribution, and the virus’s evolving nature. To gain a comprehensive understanding and make informed
decisions, it is crucial to analyze and visualize the available data.<br>
<br>
<b>Process:</B><br>
This project employs the ggplot2 library in R to create insightful visualizations based on a comprehensive
COVID-19 dataset. The dataset includes critical columns such as Date_reported, Country, WHO_region,
New_cases, Cumulative_cases, New_deaths, Cumulative_deaths, and deaths. By exploring this data, we
aim to assess the current state of the pandemic, compare it to past periods, and identify patterns and trends
that can inform future strategies.<br>
<br>
<b>Outcome:</b><br>
Through these visualizations, we seek to shed light on questions such as the resurgence of cases, regional
disparities, the impact of vaccination campaigns, and the effectiveness of public health interventions. Our
goal is not only to provide valuable insights into the current situation but also to contribute to the broader
understanding of COVID-19, ultimately aiding decision-makers, healthcare professionals, and the public in
navigating this ongoing crisis.<br>
<br>
<b>Data Explanation:</><br>
This data set contains the following parameters of COVID-19 cases in the range of year 2019-2023:
Date_reported: This column records the date on which COVID-19 cases or deaths were officially reported.
The timeline of reporting is essential for tracking the evolution of the pandemic over time, identifying peaks,
and understanding trends in case and death reporting.<br>
Country: This attribute indicates the specific country or region where the COVID-19 data was reported.
Analyzing data by country helps assess the geographical spread of the virus and the varying impacts it has
had on different regions.<br>
WHO_region: The World Health Organization (WHO) region to which the country belongs. This categorization
enables the analysis of regional differences in pandemic management, healthcare infrastructure, and
responses to COVID-19.<br>
New_cases: This column represents the number of new COVID-19 cases reported on a given date. Tracking
daily new cases helps monitor infection rates, identify surges, and assess the effectiveness of containment
measures.<br>
